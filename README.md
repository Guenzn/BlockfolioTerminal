# BlockFolio Terminal (Python 2.7)

Design is inspired by the work of [@igor_chubin](https://twitter.com/igor_chubin) for rate.sx

## Requirements
```
pip install requests --user
pip install prettytable --user
```

## How to use
  1. Get your API_TOKEN from the BlockFolio App (Settings -> at the bottom, touch to copy)
  2. Add the token in the script `API_TOKEN   = "INSERT TOKEN HERE"`
  3. Launch `./blockfolio.py`

## Quick Tips
